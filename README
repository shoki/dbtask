This program will run tasks on databases. Its mainly intended for importing db
backups into other databases via cron.

HINTS:

Be aware that having several backups with the same database name and using *
as the source_host entry in the tasks table will result in double imports.

Make sure that you have use <dbname> in your prerun/postrun SQL scripts or
they will fail.
